# Contains the "inventory object" template ConfigMap.
# When this object is applied, it is handled specially,
# storing the metadata of all the other objects applied.
# This object and its stored inventory is subsequently
# used to calculate the set of objects to automatically
# delete (prune), when an object is omitted from further
# applies. When applied, this "inventory object" is also
# used to identify the entire set of objects to delete.
#
# NOTE: The name of this inventory template file
# does NOT have any impact on group-related functionality
# such as deletion or pruning.
